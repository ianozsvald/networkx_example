networkx_example
================

Example of plotting with networkx and some interaction (mainly to help myself)

Plots a graph (example png included):

 * selects size of node from node attributes
 * selects label of a node from node attributes
 * toggles the display of labels using 't' key
 * has commented-out code to maximise the display with tight_layout()
 

TODO
----

 * react to a click on a node by registering an artist, to draw local labels
